# Entropy production in open reaction networks

For a finite family of reactions, the entropy-production rate is the gas
constant times the sum of the net reaction flux multiplied by the logarithmic
forward-to-reverse flux ratio.  Each summand is nonnegative when both fluxes
are positive, so a nonnegative gas constant gives nonnegative total entropy
production.

This follows Rao and Esposito (2016), Sections III.B--III.E.1, equation (55).
