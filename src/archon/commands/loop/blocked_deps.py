"""Detect objectives that can't be worked on because their imports don't compile.

Christian Merten's reported failure mode (the same iter that fanned out 27
provers, addressed by the dispatch cap): some of those provers were assigned
to files that imported a *blocked* file — a file the previous ``lake build``
failed on. The downstream files can't even be loaded; a prover dispatch on
them burns API time for nothing.

This module catches the case deterministically:

1. **Blocked set**: parse the most recent ``lake build`` error log
   (``.archon/last_lake_build.log``) for ``error: <file>.lean:R:C:`` lines.
   These are the files Lean refused to elaborate. Filter to files that
   actually live under the project (Mathlib mirror paths, ``.lake`` deps,
   etc. are not the planner's problem).

2. **Local import graph**: scan every project ``.lean`` file for ``import``
   statements, splitting into local (resolves to a project module) and
   external (Mathlib / Std / ...). Build a ``{file: set(local-imports)}``
   adjacency map.

3. **Transitive walk**: for each candidate objective F, BFS through its
   local imports. If any imported file is in the blocked set, F can't be
   compiled either — drop it.

4. **"Presumed-being-fixed" exception**: a blocked file that's *itself*
   in the planner's objective list is presumed-being-fixed this iter,
   so its appearance in another file's import chain doesn't disqualify
   the downstream file. The planner is allowed to assign F1 and F2
   together when F2 is blocked-and-being-fixed and F1 depends on F2 —
   the prover phase handles them in topological order via the runner's
   dispatch + the file-level locking the loop already does.

The intent is identical to the dispatch cap: warn the planner loudly,
queue the deferred files into ``AUTO_NOTES.md`` so the next plan agent
re-prioritizes from a clean slate, and slice the dispatch list at the
runner as a deterministic safety net.
