"""Post-plan validation step.

Runs between :class:`PlanPhase` and :class:`ProverPhase`. Calls
:func:`state.auto_fix_objectives` to (1) verify the plan agent produced
a PROGRESS.md that the prover dispatcher can actually parse, and (2)
silently rename common heading drift (``## Strategy`` →
``## Current Objectives``) so a productive plan isn't wasted by a
one-character format mistake. On persistent failure, appends a
*discuss-format* corrective line to ``AUTO_NOTES.md`` — the loop-managed
feedback channel the next plan agent reads and clears, kept separate from
the user-authored ``USER_HINTS.md`` — and signals the caller to skip prover
dispatch for this iteration.

Recognizes an *intentional* no-prover-this-iter marker in PROGRESS.md
— when the planner correctly skips provers for a MECHANICAL hard gate
(no ready sorries, every objective blocked by a failed upstream build,
blueprint-completeness gate failed) and writes the marker, validate
returns True, no corrective auto-note fires, and the iter completes cleanly.
A skip is NOT legitimate just because a strategy decision is pending:
per the plan prompt, the planner decides such forks itself and still
dispatches provers — it never idles an iter waiting on the user.

Also enforces soft length / structure limits on STRATEGY.md — see
:func:`_check_strategy_bounds`. STRATEGY.md has been observed bloating
to multi-thousand-line dumps with verbatim Lean source content; the
soft check logs a warning and stamps ``planValidate.strategyBloat=
true`` in meta.json so the dashboard / next iter can surface it.
