"""Helpers for the ``archon loop --resume`` flag.

Each phase calls :func:`pick_resume_session` before invoking the Claude
agent to decide whether to pass ``--resume <id>`` and replace the
priming prompt with a short continuation. After the agent returns, the
phase calls :func:`persist_session_id` to record the new (or continued)
session id in ``meta.json`` so a future ``--resume`` can find it.

When ``--resume`` is passed without ``--from``,
:func:`detect_last_interrupted_phase` picks the target by inspecting
the prior iter's ``meta.json`` — the first of plan / prover / review
whose status isn't ``"done"`` is the one that crashed.

The continuation prompts deliberately stay short: Claude Code's
``--resume`` replays the prior conversation into the model's context,
so re-priming with the full plan/prover/review prompt would just
duplicate instructions. Each prompt only nudges the model to refresh
state files that may have changed since the crash.

    ``enabled`` is the gate the caller computes (typically
    ``ctx.resume_phase == self.skip_token``; ``ctx.resume_phase`` is
    None on iter >= 1, so the gate naturally falls open for those).
    When disabled the function short-circuits to None so the caller does
    a fresh run. When enabled but no id is stored anywhere, logs a
    warning and falls back to fresh — matching the user's request that
    --resume degrade gracefully on missing state.

    ``cwd`` is the project root (the working directory Claude Code was
    invoked from). When given, the function also verifies the session's
    JSONL file actually exists in Claude Code's store
    (``~/.claude/projects/<sanitized-cwd>/<sid>.jsonl``). If the file
    is missing, the stored id is stale (Claude Code's session log was
    rotated / cleaned) and passing it to ``claude --resume`` would
    error out. We warn and fall back to fresh instead.

    ``jsonl_fallback`` is the path to the phase's stream JSONL log
    (e.g. ``iter-NNN/plan.jsonl``). When the meta key is missing —
    which happens whenever the agent crashed BEFORE ``persist_session_id``
    ran at end of phase — the function reads the session id directly
    from the JSONL's ``session_meta`` event (emitted on session start).
    If found, the id is also stamped into ``iter_meta`` so the next
    inspection of meta.json shows it. The previous behavior (give up
    and run fresh) was the "lost session" failure mode the user
    reported: the JSONL had the id all along.
