"""Install the secret-detection git hooks into outer + inner git.

Runs after :class:`InnerGitStep` so the inner-git's ``hooks/`` directory
already exists. Two hooks are installed:

- ``pre-commit`` auto-scrubs staged files in place, replacing every
  API-key-shaped string with ``ARCHON_REDACTED_SECRET`` so the commit
  proceeds with clean content (primary defense).
- ``pre-push`` is a final-check abort — if a secret-shaped string ever
  reaches a commit (e.g. bypassed pre-commit), the push is refused with
  a clear message rather than silently leaking.

Touches the outer ``<project>/.git/hooks/`` only when the user already
has an outer git repo. Never overwrites a non-Archon hook of the same
name — surfaces a warning instead so the user can merge the logic by
hand.

The bundled hooks ship with ``#!/usr/bin/env python3``, but Archon may
be installed via ``uv`` into a venv that only exposes ``python`` (no
``python3``). Git's hook runner then aborts with ``env: python3: No
such file or directory``. To avoid that, this step rewrites the
shebang to ``#!{sys.executable}`` at install time so the hook always
runs under the same interpreter Archon was installed under.
