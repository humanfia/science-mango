"""Typer entry point for ``archon merge``.

Combines two archon projects that share part of their blueprint DAG. The
``target`` is duplicated into ``--dest`` (never modified); the ``--from``
source is mounted read-only. For every declaration the two share — same
Lean name / blueprint label, same statement — the session keeps the better
proof (``--prefer source`` by default, since you usually merge a project
*because* it carries the improvement). A genuinely differing statement is a
conflict the session surfaces rather than auto-merges.

Because a swapped-in proof only type-checks against the *signatures* of the
lemmas it uses (not their proofs), best-per-declaration selection is a safe,
local operation — and the ``lake build`` verify gate (on by default here) is
what proves the merged result actually holds together.

    """Merge two archon projects via the DAG, keeping the best shared proofs.

    Duplicates TARGET into --dest (hardlinked .lake, fresh git history,
    knowledge files carried over), mounts --from read-only, then opens an
    interactive session that:

    \b
      1. agrees with you which shared cones / seeds to merge,
      2. computes the import plan from the source's blueprint DAG
         (`archon dag-carve-plan --project-path <source>`),
      3. for each shared declaration, takes the --prefer side's proof (pulling
         in any source-only auxiliary lemmas it needs); surfaces statement
         conflicts for your call; with --union also imports the source's own
         cones,
      4. adapts README / PROGRESS.md / STRATEGY.md / references.

    \b
    After the session a deterministic gate verifies the result: the DAG
    rebuilds with zero broken \\uses{}, every agreed node is present, and
    (by default) `lake build` succeeds. Only then is the sandbox finalized
    with a fresh outer git history.

    \b
    Examples:
      archon merge ~/proj/B --from ~/proj/A --dest ~/proj/AB
      archon merge ~/proj/B --from ~/proj/A --dest ~/proj/AB --union
      archon merge ~/proj/B --from ~/proj/A --dest ~/proj/AB --prefer target
