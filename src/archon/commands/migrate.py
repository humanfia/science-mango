"""One-off maintenance commands for legacy Archon projects.

Currently only ``archon migrate rename-sessions``: rename the
pre-2026 monotonic ``proof-journal/sessions/session_N/`` directories
to match their corresponding iteration number, so they line up with
the post-2026 ``session_<iter>`` convention. Idempotent and safe to
re-run — already-correct sessions are skipped.
