"""Prompt builders for Archon's plan / prover / review phases.

The actual ``claude`` invocation lives in :mod:`archon.agent`. This
module only constructs the prompt strings handed to the agent. The
session-end inspection helpers (which read the JSONL log after a run)
live in :mod:`archon.session_log`.

Design principle: anything the loop can do deterministically (read a
file, run a check, compute a summary) is injected INTO this module's
output rather than asked of the agent. The agent reads what's in
front of it; the agent does NOT mechanically "go read file X then
clear it". File-reading and file-clearing are the loop's job.

        - Automated validation notes from the previous iter's plan-validate (dropped/blocked/deferred objectives, format corrections) are injected below under `## Automated validation notes` when there were any. These are loop-generated, NOT user input — the user-authored `USER_HINTS.md` never carries them.
        - The prior iter's blueprint-doctor findings are injected below under `## Blueprint doctor — live structural findings` (when there were any). You do NOT need to read `logs/iter-{{prev}}/blueprint-doctor.md`; act on what's inline.
        - The leandag graph state (ready-to-prove frontier, ∞-effort holes, broken `\\uses` refs, Lean ↔ blueprint coverage debt) is injected below under `## Blueprint graph state (leandag)` — the same graph the dashboard DAG page shows.

        ## Physics-aware typed blueprint policy

        This DAG run is preparing a physics formalization blueprint. Keep the
        Archon blueprint/theorem-DAG structure, but make the physical modeling
        choices explicit before asking the prover to fill proofs.

        Requirements for physics chapters:
        - Put the marker `% archon:physics` near the top of every chapter that
          introduces or depends on physical modeling.
        - Add typed modeling nodes for load-bearing physical quantities before
          theorem/proof-route nodes that use them. Each modeling node should say
          what the quantity represents, what its units or dimensions are in the
          problem, and what Lean declaration should encode that meaning.
        - Symbols and image labels from the statement or diagram must be
          captured as named assumptions/parameters, even when they do not appear
          in the final closed-form answer.
        - No unsupported scalar fallback: do not replace concepts such as
          charge, current, force, magnetic/electric fields, radius, distance,
          voltage, energy, or similar physical quantities by bare `Real`/`ℝ`
          unless the blueprint explicitly justifies that this is a scalar
          projection and names the lost physical structure.
        - When existing PhysLean/mathlib support is unknown, state the intended
          typed local model in the blueprint rather than weakening the statement.
          The later Lean synthesis/proof phases can decide how much of that
          model is available.
        - Include physical-hypothesis nodes before theorem nodes that use
          arbitrary mathematical objects. A field component bundle, force
          function, trajectory, potential, current, or distribution is just data
          until a law/constraint node connects it to the setup. Add nodes such
          as Coulomb superposition, Gauss/source-free law, symmetry, Newton's
          second law, Lorentz force, Ohm/Kirchhoff law, boundary conditions, or
          calibration/measurement relations as explicit dependencies.
        - Do not write theorem blocks whose statement effectively says
          "for every arbitrary field/force/motion, the target physical formula
          holds." The theorem's left-hand side must include the governing
          physical assumptions, either directly or through dependency nodes.
          These governing physical assumptions are part of the blueprint DAG,
          not commentary to hide in the proof.

          it is not reviewable as a grounded physics formalization.
        - Run a statement-structure anti-fake audit, even when `lake env lean`
          passes. This is a reviewer judgment, not a deterministic
          blueprint-doctor regex: local approximations written as global
          equalities, tautological propositions, and disconnected
          trace/symmetry/slope claims are BLOCKER findings.
        - Check physical-hypothesis completeness. A theorem that quantifies an
          arbitrary field, force, trajectory, potential, circuit quantity,
          wave, or distribution and concludes a physical formula needs an
          explicit governing-law premise or dependency: Coulomb/Gauss/symmetry,
          Newton/Lorentz force, Ohm/Kirchhoff, boundary conditions, or
          measurement/calibration assumptions as appropriate. Missing this
          left-hand side is a BLOCKER, not merely an unfinished proof.
        - Run a goal-faithfulness / answer-as-assumption audit. Split each
          target into governing laws, previous-part results, figure/data
          readouts, and the current target conclusion. The current target
          conclusion must not be hidden inside hypotheses, `Laws` fields,
          `Valid...Physics` fields, `Satisfies...` predicates, `...Law`
          premises, or local definitions that the theorem merely unfolds.
          If this happens, report `BLOCKED ON MODELING` and route the next
          iteration to redraft/formalize rather than continue proving.
        - Run a derivability audit, independently of whether the file compiles.
          Enumerate the nontrivial bridges from the allowed assumptions to the
          requested output and identify the Lean theorem, structure field, or
          local law that carries each bridge. A missing bridge is a BLOCKER.
        - Audit abstract `Prop`-valued interfaces for usable mathematical
          consequences. An opaque tangency, limiting-path, asymptotic,
          extremal, or validity predicate that is only witnessed but has no
          equation, inequality, derivative, limit, incidence condition, or
          elimination theorem leaves the contract underdetermined and is a
          BLOCKER.
        - Attempt an adversarial countermodel sanity check: ask whether local
          functions and predicates can be interpreted arbitrarily while every
          hypothesis remains true and the target becomes false. If so, report
          `BLOCKED ON MODELING`; compilation and source-like naming do not
          compensate for lack of derivability.
        - Audit uncertainty/error propagation. If the source or a previous-part
          result reports `value ± uncertainty`, require the uncertainty to
          occur in the target contract and in a propagation law or interval
          argument. Merely proving a central value lies inside a fixed output
          band is not sufficient.
        - Audit signed branches and orientation. Incoming/outgoing,
          future/past, clockwise/counterclockwise, tangent choice, and
          asymptotic direction needed by the requested answer must be fixed by
          assumptions or derived bridge lemmas, not chosen only in the
          conclusion.
        - For local approximations, first-order expansions, and linearization,
          reject global exact equalities unless the statement uses a real local
          calculus/asymptotics contract such as `HasDerivAt`, `HasFDerivAt`,
          `IsLittleO`/`IsBigO` (`=o`/`=O`), an explicit neighborhood, or an
          explicit remainder/error term.
        - Reject ghost propositions such as `True`, `∃ _, True`, reflexive
          algebra, or internally introduced scalar witnesses that are not
          connected to the field/function/model by equations or predicates.
        - For trace, symmetry, slope, Jacobian, divergence, and source-free
          claims, verify the statement mentions the actual field/function and
          connects the claim through `deriv`, `fderiv`, `HasDerivAt`,
          `HasFDerivAt`, divergence, Jacobian, limit, or asymptotic operators.
          A disconnected scalar equation is a BLOCKER, not a proof TODO.
        - Verify the Lean statements do not replace the physics claim with
          `True`, reflexive algebra, unsupported `ℝ` aliases, or one-field
          wrappers that erase units/dimensions.
        - Verify problem and figure parameters are captured even when they are
          only used in later proof steps.
        - If the `physics-reviewer` subagent is enabled, dispatch it for each
          physics Lean/blueprint pair touched this iter. If it is not enabled,
          apply the same checklist yourself and note that no dedicated
          `physics-reviewer` report exists.

            Judge the formal statement independently of proof completion.
            `passed` requires faithful source/figure/units/laws, truthful
            grounding, no answer-as-assumption or globalized approximation,
            no live modeling/grounding doctor blocker, all mandatory structured
            checks passing (or explicitly not applicable where allowed), at
            least one covered bridge obligation, and no blocked bridge. Missing
            checks, missing evidence, an empty bridge inventory, or
            a legacy bare `passed` verdict is `failed`, never an implicit pass.
            The orchestrator retries failed targets and permanently blocks
            them from prover dispatch after the configured maximum Review
            attempts.
