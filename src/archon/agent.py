"""Wrapped Claude Code CLI invocation.

Centralizes how archon launches `claude` so model selection, permission
flags, and structured JSONL logging are consistent across every phase
agent (plan, refactor, prover, review, discuss). All sites that talk to
the `claude` binary should go through ``ClaudeAgent`` — when we later
swap engines (e.g., OpenClaw or another orchestrator), only this class
changes.

Quick reference:
    agent = ClaudeAgent(model="opus")
    agent.run(prompt, cwd=project, log_base=phase_log)   # headless `-p`
    agent.run_interactive(prompt, cwd=project)           # foreground TUI

    # Auto-restart on a hung provider (e.g. overnight Kimi run):
    agent.run(
        prompt, cwd=project, log_base=phase_log,
        idle_timeout_s=900,   # 15 min of zero JSONL activity
        max_attempts=3,       # then re-run the same prompt up to 3x
    )

DEFAULT_MODEL = "opus"


# Native Claude Code tools that every archon agent is forbidden to use,
# passed to ``claude --disallowedTools``.
#
# Archon's whole orchestration model assumes each phase agent runs as a
# one-shot headless ``claude -p`` whose turn does NOT end until all the
# work it spawned is done: the orchestrator (e.g. DagElaborationPhase)
# blocks on the subprocess and advances to the next iteration the moment
# it exits. The only sanctioned way to dispatch a subagent is the
# *blocking* ``python3 .claude/tools/archon-subagent.py`` Bash call (see
# the dispatcher pattern in prompts/dag.md and prompts/plan.md) — it runs
# the child synchronously inside the dispatching agent's turn, so the
# headless process stays alive until every dispatch returns.
#
# The native ``Agent`` (sub-agent spawn) and ``ScheduleWakeup`` tools
# break that contract: an agent that backgrounds its dispatches and
# schedules a wakeup ends its turn immediately. In headless ``-p`` there
# is no persistent runtime to honor the wakeup, so the process exits, the
# orchestrator treats the clean exit as "phase done" and launches the
# next iteration — while the just-spawned subagents are still in flight,
# now orphaned and racing the next iteration's writes to the same files.
# (The stream parser already *detects* this as ``[session ended
# mid-dispatch]``; blocking the tools is what *prevents* it.)
#
# The actual in-turn wait is *staying inside the blocking foreground dispatch
# Bash call*: ``archon-subagent.py`` is synchronous (``subprocess.run``), and
# ``BASH_FOREGROUND_TIMEOUT_MS`` (below) raises the auto-background ceiling to
# 30 min so a normal dispatch — including a ``& … & wait`` wave — stays
# foreground and holds the turn open until every child has written its report.
# ``prompts/{plan,dag,review}.md`` direct the agent to that pattern and to read
# the reports only *after* the call returns, all in the one-shot turn (there is
# no resume runtime / "next turn").
#
# ``Monitor`` is NOT a wait primitive here: it streams events and returns
# control immediately ("keep working"), so an agent that "waits" with Monitor
# ends its turn with the dispatch still in flight — the historical fable-5
# failure. The prompts therefore forbid using it to wait. It is left out of the
# disallow list only because nothing in the loop relies on it and the real
# primitives (Bash/Read/Write/Edit) are unaffected; if prompt discipline ever
# proves insufficient, adding ``Monitor`` here is a safe further hardening.
# The genuine turn-enders are ``Agent``/``Task`` (spawn-and-return) and
# ``ScheduleWakeup`` (async wakeup with no blocking mode); those stay banned.
#
# ``Task`` is included defensively to cover CLI builds that name the
# spawner ``Task`` rather than ``Agent``; archon never relies on a native
# task-checklist tool, so disallowing it is harmless. Bash/Read/Write/
# Edit/Grep/Glob/WebSearch/WebFetch/TodoWrite are unaffected.

#
# Claude Code defaults a Bash command to a 2-minute timeout with a
# 10-minute hard ceiling, and AUTO-BACKGROUNDS a foreground command that
# overruns it (``Command running in background with ID: …``). That is
# fatal to archon's dispatch model: the sanctioned way to launch a
# subagent is a *blocking* ``python3 .archon/.../archon-subagent.py`` Bash
# call whose child ``claude`` session routinely runs 10-15+ minutes. Once
# that call auto-backgrounds, the dispatching agent's turn ends, the
# headless ``-p`` process exits, and the orchestrator advances to the
# next iteration while the subagent is still running (the same race the
# DISALLOWED_NATIVE_TOOLS guard addresses, reached by a different door).
# The planner never trips this only because its subagents finish under
# the 2-minute default; the dag-walkers reliably exceed it.
#
# 30 minutes comfortably covers a large dependency-cone walker. A
# genuinely hung child is still bounded by the inner agent's own idle
# watchdog (``idle_timeout_s`` in ``run``), which kills the child claude
# and lets the Bash call return — so a high ceiling doesn't mean a
# wedged dispatch runs forever. Set via setdefault so a shell/user
# override still wins.

        Returns True iff claude exited zero (or zero-with-valid-
        session_end). When ``log_base`` is given, writes
        ``{log_base}.jsonl`` (parsed events) and optionally
        ``{log_base}.raw.jsonl`` (verbose stream).

        ``env_overrides`` is forwarded to the spawned subprocess so lane
        runs can set provider-specific variables (e.g. an alternate
        ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL``) without leaking them into the parent.
        When the agent's own ``model`` is a non-Anthropic provider alias,
        the matching provider env vars are merged in here too —
        caller-supplied overrides win on conflict.

        ``cancel_event`` is checked while waiting for claude to finish.
        Setting it from another thread sends SIGTERM to the spawned
        process, lets it tear down for up to 5 seconds, then SIGKILLs.
        Used by multilane to stop slow lanes once another lane has won
        the same file. Returns False on cancellation.

        ``idle_timeout_s`` enables a watchdog: if no JSONL event is
        written for this many seconds, claude is killed and (when
        ``max_attempts`` > 1) the same prompt is re-run. This catches
        third-party providers (Kimi, DeepSeek) whose connections
        sometimes hang silently — a 15-minute idle threshold turns an
        overnight stall into a 15-minute hiccup. Only the watchdog path
        retries; real failures (auth errors, bad prompts) return False
        immediately so we don't double-bill on something a retry can't
        fix. Requires ``log_base`` (the watchdog reads the JSONL's
        mtime); ignored without it.

        ``max_attempts`` caps the retry count. Default 1 preserves
        legacy behaviour — no auto-restart unless the caller opts in.

        ``resume_session_id`` enables Claude Code's session-resume mode.
        When set, ``--resume <id>`` is prepended to the command so claude
        continues the prior conversation instead of starting fresh; the
        ``prompt`` then acts as the next user turn (callers typically
        send a short "continue from where you left off" message). The
        caller is responsible for sourcing the id (e.g. from a prior
        iter's meta.json via ``state.read_meta``).

        When the backend is :class:`InteractiveBackend`, this routes to the

    are how the command is built and how success is judged, so everything

    The agent process is launched with ``stdout`` either piped into

    Exactly one of ``parser_cmd`` / ``stdout_dest`` must be given. The
    process whose lifetime the watchdog loop polls is the parser when
    present, else the agent itself.

    The idle watchdog uses the mtime of ``activity_path`` (defaults to
    ``jsonl_path``) as a cheap liveness signal: every emitted event
    flushes the JSONL, so a stalled provider stops bumping the mtime and
    is killed after ``idle_timeout_s`` seconds. ``on_idle_timeout`` is an
    optional ``(idle_s, attempt) -> None`` callback fired just before the
    kill (used to stamp an ``idle_timeout`` row into the log).
