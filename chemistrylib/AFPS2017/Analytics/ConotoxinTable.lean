# Source-addressed conotoxin mass table

The 25 expected and observed masses below are transcribed row by row from
`afps2017.supplement:Supplementary-Figure-8` in the public supplement with
content identifier
`afps2017.supplement:sha256-f7baa2cd59141ec38d95c9980e60117b596a9a78a9f4cbd4ae4e2cd4a2c8044e`.
Expected and observed displayed precisions are recorded independently, and the
source does not specify a product form for these table entries.

The checked table establishes only exact arithmetic facts about the displayed
masses: entry 14 attains the independently computed maximum absolute residual
of `0.193` Da, and every residual is at most `0.2` Da. It makes no conclusion
about molecular identity, structure, purity, folding, or yield.
