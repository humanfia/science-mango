# Rate equations for open reaction networks

The rate of change of a species is split into a stoichiometric reaction
contribution and an externally supplied reservoir current.  The reaction
fluxes and reservoir currents remain explicit parameters: this module does not
prescribe a kinetic law or a model of the chemostats.

This follows Rao and Esposito (2016), Sections II.B–II.C, equations (7)–(16),
in particular the internal-species and chemostatted-species rate equations
(9) and (10).
