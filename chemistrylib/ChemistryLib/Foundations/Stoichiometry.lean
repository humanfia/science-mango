# Stoichiometric numbers

A stoichiometric number assigns a signed rational coefficient to each species:
products have positive coefficients, reactants have negative coefficients, and a
species participates precisely when its coefficient is nonzero.  For a finite
species type, the stoichiometric support collects exactly those participating
species.
