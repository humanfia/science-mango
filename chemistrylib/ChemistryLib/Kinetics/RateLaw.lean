# Positive mass-action rate switching

For two mass-action fluxes with a common positive factor, this module gives the
competitor concentration at which the fast pathway overtakes the slow pathway.

The rate-law interpretation follows the IUPAC Gold Book entries for rate of
reaction and rate law (`research:iupac_goldbook_2025:mass_action_rate_law`,
terms R05141 and 08184).  The rate-switch formulation is motivated by
`icho_2026_t2_a3:T2-A3`.
